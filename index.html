        <h1>How to Make a Sandwich</h1>
            <ol>
                    <li><b>Spread Out</b><br>
                        Sandwich spreads add flavor but also perform the essential task of lending moisture and <br>
                        sometimes creaminess to sandwiches. Mustard and mayo are the familiar standbys, but don’t <br>
                        stop there. It’s well worth experimenting with the following: vinaigrettes, pestos, BBQ sauces, <br>
                        chutneys, and salsas.
                    <li><b>Use the Right Bread</b><br>
                        Choose bread appropriate to the sandwich you’re making. Pair moist fillings with soft, fluffy <br>
                        breads and you’ve got a recipe for a sponge, not a sandwich. As a general rule, the moister the <br>
                        filling the drier and denser the bread should be. A good, thick crust helps, too. Swap in large flour <br>
                        tortillas, if you like, for moist fillings. They keep ingredients in check and maintain their integrity <br>
                        much better than many breads.</li>
                    <li><b>Choose To-Go Toppings</b><br>
                        We love lettuce and tomato in sandwiches. They lend moisture, crunch and freshness and provide <br>
                        a wonderful foil for heavy, rich ingredients. They are, however, almost entirely water, and thus over <br>
                        extended periods are prone to wilting and, worse, making bread soggy. Luckily there are plenty of <br>
                        vegetables that offer all the benefits of lettuce and tomato without the drawbacks. In place of <br>
                        sliced tomatoes, for instance, try giving roasted peppers. (It helps if you first blot the peppers dry <br>
                        with a paper towel). Instead of lettuce, experiment with other vegetables, like sliced fennel, <br>
                        spinach, shredded cabbage, or cucumber.</li>
                    <li><b>Stave Off Sogginess</b><br>
                        Spread mayo, butter or cream cheese all the way to the edges of each slice of bread to create a <br>
                        seal against wet sandwich fillings. Also, try packing high moisture ingredients, like tomatoes, <br>
                        pickles, and cucumbers, separately. Just add them to the sandwich when you’re ready to eat. <br>
                        Toasting the bread can help, too.</li>
                    <li><b>Take the Edge Off Onions</b><br>
                        Onions can give sandwiches a welcome bite but often must be tamed a bit to be enjoyed raw. <br>
                        There are two effective ways to take some of the edge off sliced onions: Either soak thinly sliced <br>
                        onions in ice water for 20 minutes or so. Then drain and blot dry. (This method adds crispness.) <br>
                        Or toss sliced onions with a generous sprinkling of kosher salt. Wait a few minutes. Rub salt into <br>
                        the onions, rinse, drain.</li>
